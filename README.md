# Hey, I'm Dmytro 👋

**Founding AI Engineer @ [Parcha](https://parcha.com)** — Building AI agents for compliance automation

I design and ship production LLM systems for KYC, AML, and adverse media screening. My work sits at the intersection of AI reliability and regulatory requirements — where getting it wrong isn't an option.

### 🚀 Latest: Grep.ai

Just shipped **[Grep](https://grep.ai)** — an AI-powered business due diligence agent built on Anthropic's Agent SDK.

Give it a business name, get a complete intelligence report in under 3 minutes:
- Verified business profiles across 190+ jurisdictions
- UBO verification and ownership structures  
- Sanctions screening (OFAC, UN, EU, UK), PEP checks, adverse media
- Risk assessment with cited sources

Try it free through December with code `GREPIT` → [grep.ai](https://grep.ai)

### What I'm building

- 🤖 **Multi-agent orchestration** — Claude API, Anthropic Agent SDK, tool use at scale
- 📊 **LLM evaluation systems** — Statistical frameworks for compliance-critical AI
- 📄 **Document understanding** — OCR, entity extraction, cross-document verification
- ⚡ **Production infrastructure** — AWS/GCP/Kubernetes, Terraform, Redis/Celery, microservices 

### Background

Previously ML Team Lead at **Carvana** and Senior MLE at **Augment CXM** (5 years). 15+ years shipping data systems across fintech, automotive, and enterprise.

## 🧪 Side Projects & Experiments

### 🌳 [K-Base](https://github.com/KDmytro/k-base) — Branching Conversation AI

Exploring how conversation structure affects learning and brainstorming. Built a prototype that treats AI chats as trees instead of linear logs.

**Key idea**: What if you could fork any conversation, explore multiple solution paths simultaneously, and collapse tangents without losing context?

**Stack**: React + TypeScript, FastAPI, PostgreSQL + pgvector, LiteLLM  
**Status**: Phase 2 complete (branching + streaming working), exploring RAG integration next

**Why this matters**: Most chat interfaces force linear thinking. K-Base lets you think in parallel — branch to explore "what if" scenarios, maintain multiple hypotheses, and use AI more like a collaborative thought partner than a sequential Q&A bot.

Current features:
- Branch conversations at any point
- Tree visualization with SVG rendering
- Streaming responses with SSE
- Session memory and context management

Next up: Collapsible branches with AI summaries, cross-session RAG, user annotations.

*This started as a personal tool for exploring complex technical decisions where I wanted to preserve multiple solution paths. Turns out tree-structured conversations are pretty useful for learning and brainstorming too.*
