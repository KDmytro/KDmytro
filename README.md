I design and ship production LLM systems for KYC, AML, and adverse media screening. My work sits at the intersection of AI reliability and regulatory requirements — where getting it wrong isn't an option.

- 📄 **Document understanding** — OCR, entity extraction, cross-document verification
- ⚡ **Production infrastructure** — AWS/GCP/Kubernetes, Terraform, Redis/Celery, microservices 

### Background

### Current interests
